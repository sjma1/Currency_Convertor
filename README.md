# Currency_Convertor
A Currency Convertor App for Android created using the Frankfurter API.

This app consists of an input field for the user to input the amount to convert, two spinners that represent the base currency 
and the currency to convert to, and two buttons.

The first button is the Convert button. When pressed, this will cause the app to parse the JSON info based on the user's selections.
This JSON info is obtained by visiting a URL based on the Frankfurter API that obtains its currency exchange rates based on the 
European Central Bank.

The second button is the Reset button which will clear the input and output fields and reset the spinners back to their default
positions of USD and EUR.
